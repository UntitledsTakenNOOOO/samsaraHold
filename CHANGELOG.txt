SAMSARA CHANGES
- Chex Zorches custom enemies, of course.
- Duke taunts on custom enemies, because I would feel bad if people complained about it.
- Duke's Freezethrower and Parias' Frost shards do extra damage against fire-based enemies, as a benefit to those who read the README, and to make them usable (since freezethrower is pretty terrible for a slot 6).
- The weapon powerup device now spreads three specials and a mystic ambit for team use. Sorry, folks, but making an original powered-up version of every samsara weapon is not in our itinerary at the moment, and never will be.
- 3 Uniques item has a max of 3, rather than 1, since it's not that powerful.
- Fuel for flamer replaced by various heretic/hexen utilities. No, I'm not telling what.
^- Landmines give a slot one. Ammo for landmines replaced with strife missile boxes (the strife everything ammo pickups)
^- Autoshotgun is a slot 2+3
^- HRL is a slot 5+1 unique.
^- Stunner is 3 uniques straight up.
^- Railgun is slot 6+1 unique.
^- Flamer is slot6+2 uniques.
^- Pyro Cannon is slot7+2 uniques.
^- Repeater is slot6+2 uniques.
^- Devastator(Stronghold one, not Samsara one, which is renamed to " Devastator " to prevent code confusion, sorry) is slot7+2 uniques.
^- Most custom weapons also drop uniques as you can see, as to allow them to see more play, as they have to be split among the team.
- Fusion Pistol does some extra-extra damage versus the terminator, due to its entirely mechanical nature.
- The terminator explodes when killed by the fusion pistol, in reference to Marathon's hunters.
- Catharsi Detonators provide some extra explosive oomph if shot with the fusion pistol, along with detonating prematurely.
- Marine Item replaced with strife beacon.
^- Super Marine Item replaced with a custom, "elite" strife beacon. (Oh god I'm not looking forward for the ninth hero anymore)
- Random weapon device now can also give a unique, and now works for samsara.
^- Random weapon's chances for each slot are NOT equal. The chances of getting a slot 7 is 3%-4%, for example.
- Core now immune to friendly fire, which required a new damagetype "FaithInHumanity" because seriously, why are you that dedicated to core-trolling?!
- Custom mechanical monsters take appropriate damage from the fusion pistol.
- Security Officer attains both WSTEM-5s on pick up, as per invasion mode.
- Parias' and Corvus' medikit capacity has been reduced to 4, and urn/invulnerability/megasphere capacity to 1, to prevent mass stealing from these classes (harming the team). This is for in-mission items, not buyable ones.
^- In mission Timefreeze and quad damages give corvus inventory ones. 
^- These are separate from the ones you buy.
- Custom Samsara difficulty names have been removed, as they would cause monsters not to spawn.
- Chainsaw, Super Bootspork, Gauntlet, Knife and Mjolnir damage and/or stunlock potential buffed, in order to let Doomguy, Chex, Corvus, BJ and Ranger share in the slot 1 fun.
- Because of melee weapons being terrible in Stronghold, PunchDrunk saws and uniques are super-buffed.
- Parias' Backpack capacity limited to 1, but it gives full ammo instead of half, in order to prevent mass-steals and to prevent overpoweredness with having 6 and a RWD'd wraithverge.
- Various damage values have been tweaked for balance (most noticable on Parias, as I had to buff him out due to him being melee-only). The bad news is that I forgot most of them.
-The shop is modified to have a new room to adjust Armor Mode settings.
-New Achievements!
NOTE: This is meant to be played in coop mode. If UV single player is Impossible at certain points, please do not complain. Just play HMP, or start farming some items first. Also, give yourself "CoopModeOn" to let samsara do some stuff.
STRONGHOLD CHANGES
- Most of these should remain secret, but...
- Par times are now much, much, much larger (as in like 4 Times Longer), as to allow people to have an easy time re-running previous missions for free cash. Now, the real goal is get the Time Slicer Achievement (Yes, that's a thing).
- Changes to various missions all over the place. Most of these are going to remain secret, since, well, I want you to be surprised... Here, I'll give one to you.
- STR18 (Smoldering Caves) replaced with STR18 (Delta Bunker) from the RC2, because seriously, Delta Bunker was more worthy of being in Tier 4, and much cooler than Smoldering Caves. It's also much harder.
- Changes to various monsters. Most of these should not be noticeable, with the Key Word being "Most". Again, most of these are to remain secret.
- The one I'm giving to you is that Dune Warriors can now be shot while cloaked, because they say they have a cloaking device, not a phase-out-of-existence device (same goes to apprentices in STR52 btw)!
-The Bruiser Demon Powerup, as fun as it was, had it's novelty wear out a long time ago. I replaced with a Terminator Powerup. Much better.
-I have a separate patch for the non Samsara related changes.
